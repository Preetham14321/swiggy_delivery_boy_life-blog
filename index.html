      </h3>
      <p class="answer">
        Well, there are many reasons why i choose Swiggy over other Platforms.
        <ul>
          <li>You get worth Money which is equal to your hardwork / smartwork </li>
          <li>According to our availability or when we have free time we can work and earn.</li>
          <li>We have Many schems to protect our self and families which is known as " Swiggy Suraksha". the following things we avail by this scheme <ul>
            <li>Covid Loss of Pay & Hospitalization Support - Guaranteed pay of â‚¹ 14,000 </li>
            <li>We have Hospitalization insurance (DP & familiy ) worth of â‚¹ 1.5 Lakh </li>
            <li>Loss of life Support of â‚¹ 5 Lakh </li>
          </ul> </li>
          <li>Swiggy gonna credit day by day payment to our Account ASP our earnings.</li>
          Might be other platforms also offer this type of schemes / things  but i'm not felt worth to this Swiggy. 
          <br>
          Not only this we have many other things... which i will explain further
