      </h3>
      <p class="answer">
        Well, there are many reasons why i choose Swiggy over other Platforms.
        <ul>
          <li>You get worth Money which is equal to your hardwork / smartwork </li>
          <li>According to our availability or when we have free time we can work and earn.</li>
          <li>We have Many schems to protect our self and families which is known as " Swiggy Suraksha". the following things we avail by this scheme <ul>
            <li>Covid Loss of Pay & Hospitalization Support - Guaranteed pay of â‚¹ 14,000 </li>
            <li>We have Hospitalization insurance (DP & familiy ) worth of â‚¹ 1.5 Lakh </li>
            <li>Loss of life Support of â‚¹ 5 Lakh </li>
          </ul> </li>
          <li>Swiggy gonna credit day by day payment to our Account ASP our earnings.</li>
          Might be other platforms also offer this type of schemes / things  but i'm not felt worth to this Swiggy. 
          <br>
          Not only this we have many other things... which i will explain further
        </ul>

      <h3 class="question"><span class="arrow"> âž¡ </span> How our Day Starts ?</h3>
      <p class="answer">You know i hardly work around 10 - 12 hours per day we have multiple roles like 
      <br>
      -Part time work <br>
      -Full time work
      <br>
      I work as a Part time. the timings are, my duty start at 7:00 PM and ends at 1:00 AM. But I used to start at sharply 6:30 PM and stop at around 4:00 AM.
      <h4 class="subheading">   -------- The Full description of our day ! -------- </h4>
      <ul>
      -the usual thing we do first to open Swiggy delivery App and start our duty by wearing following things.
      <br>
      - Mask <br>
      -Swiggy T-shirt <br>
      -Swiggy bag ( we need to carry along with us) <br>
      -Power Bank ( Main Weapon)
      
      </ul>
      Journey Starts Now ........ <br>
      Few minutes later we get an Order. Then we hardly kick the bike kickrod to start bike ( some people use self ) to reach the resturent and pickup the Order. after travelling  few miles we reach the Resturent. <br>
       Here the Real War starts as Flood Victims fight for Pulihora Packets we need to "Shout " at Resturent as  - Bhaiya Order id - 2333 ( something ) among other delivery Executives after shouting long after he responds as - " Bhaiya food tayar horaye 5 minute wait karo ". <br>
         -------waiting For more than 5 mints-------- <br>

         asking them again " Bhaiya Food kya hua 5 mints tho  ho gaya aur kithna time wait karna ? " ( need  to repeat this Statement for more than 5-10 times ) <br>
         he responds again as - ( "same mentioned as Before" ) Bhaiya 5 mints ruko ........ <br> <br>
         After wasting valueble time at Resturent we get food and take the pic of food and start our Journey towords the customer Location. <br>
         After reaching the customer Location . Deliver the item to the customer with love and respect <br> <br>
         <h4 class="subheading">------ The Drama played in Journey while travelling to customer Location-----</h4>
         After Pickuping the food from the resturent we open the Google maps (For purpose of Navigation.) And start moving while travelling i don't know why the Google map think as a enemy. it (here map) takes as to bleady Roads in which there is no chance to move forword. even by challenging ourself we move forword <br>
         <h5>" WHERE THE POLICE COPS TRAVELL FOR PETROLLING AT DAY & NIGHT WE TRAVELL ALONG WITH THEM WHERE THEY CANNOT TRAVELL WE TRAVEL AT THEIR AS WELL " </h5>
        we people face so many challenges like we need to fight with the road to not enter in damaged road ( I mean not go through the wholes / broken Roads) . <br>
         Travelling for while we reach customer Location here another drama starts ( Not all customers but few of them ) <br> <h5 class="subheading"> The Following Steps we follow :</h5>
         <ol>
           <li>Calling the customer</li>
           <li>Most of the customers not respond for first call we  need to call them again </li>
           <li>call responded by customer. <br> Our conversation will be like this </li>
           <ul>
             <li>Me : Sir / Madam reached to Location  </li>
             <li>customer : ok come to 3rd (something) </li>
             (There will be few lines of conversation will happen i don't like to present here)
           </ul>

         </ol>
         <h4>" THE THING WHICH WE FEEL BOTHER ALLTIME THAT WE DONT GET BACK THE WAY HOW WE APPROACHED THEM ( WE RESPECT THEM FROM OUR BOTTOM OF THE HEART BUT WE PEOPLE NOT GETTING IT IN RETURN BACK FROM THE CUSTOMER) " THEY TREAT US AS THEIR SLAVES " NOT ONLY ME MANY DELIVERY EXECUTIVES ARE FACING THIS IN DAY TO DAY LIFE".</h4>

         Finally we deliver order to the customer.......

         <h5 class="subheading">----- SAME PROCESS WILL BE CONTINUES UNITLL WE STOP OUR DUTY -----</h5>
